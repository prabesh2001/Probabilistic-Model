### Project Description

This project implements a **Probabilistic Information Retrieval System** using the **Binary Independence Model (BIM)**. The system processes text documents and computes relevance scores for queries based on term frequencies and document frequencies. Key features include:

- Text preprocessing using tokenization and cleaning.
- Calculation of term frequencies and document frequencies.
- Relevance scoring based on the BIM model.
- Document ranking for each query, displaying the top 3 results.
- Output of ranked results to both the console and a results file.

This project provides hands-on experience with probabilistic models in information retrieval, highlighting the complexities of ranking and scoring documents efficiently.
